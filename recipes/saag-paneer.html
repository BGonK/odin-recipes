        <h3>Proof that often the best recipes are the simplest, this spinach and paneer curry makes a flavoursome vegetarian side or serve as a main with chapati</h3>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 x 250g pack paneer, cut into 2cm cubes</li>
                <li>5 tbsp rapeseed oil</li>
                <li>450g frozen chopped spinach</li>
                <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
                <li>½ -1 tsp hot chilli powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp ground turmeric</li>
                <li>4 fat garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
                <li>2 tbsp natural yogurt</li>
                <li>juice of ½ lemon</li>
                <li>3 tbsp single cream (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>FOR THE PANEER MARINADE</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>½ tsp ground turmeric</li>
                <li>½ tsp chilli powder</li>
                <li>½ tsp fine sea salt</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <p><em>Marinade the paneer up to 24 hours ahead</em></p>
            <ol>
                <li>With a fork, make a few holes in each paneer cube and then mix well with the marinade ingredients. You can fry these immediately but the paneer benefits from a longer marinating time, even overnight if possible.</li>
                <li>Fry the paneer in about 3 tablespoons of the oil in a large frying pan set over a medium-high heat until nicely browned, then remove and set aside.</li>
                <li>Add the spinach to a saucepan with a couple of tablespoons of water, cover and cook until defrosted.</li>
                <li>Now heat the remaining oil in the frying pan over a medium-high heat. When hot, add the cumin seeds and stir them around in the oil for about 30 seconds, then add the chilli powder and turmeric. Stir in the chopped garlic and fry until it is light golden brown in colour. Be careful not to burn the garlic or it will turn bitter.</li>
                <li>Add the spinach to the frying pan and stir in the yogurt, 1 tablespoon at a time. Stir in the fried paneer and heat through.</li>
                <li>Season to taste with salt and lemon juice and serve immediately. I like to stir in a little single cream to finish off.</li>
            </ol>
