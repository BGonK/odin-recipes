                <li>Add vegetable stock, bay leaves and season to taste with salt & pepper. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and cook for about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>When the tomatoes are cooked, remove the pot from heat, then remove the bay leaves and blend into a smooth soup with a stick blender.</li>
